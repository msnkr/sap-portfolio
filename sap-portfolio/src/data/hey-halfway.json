    "title": "Hey Halfway",
    "content": "The challenge: Car sales is an oversaturated market because of this people don’t trust the dealers. The solution: South Africans have a great sense of humour. Taking inspiration from The Office we created a campaign that showcased the Hey Halfway branch and staff in a fuand humorous way. My team conceptualised the campaign idea - “No Jokes” as a light hearted way to show the trustworthiness of the brand. I came up with and wrote a number of skit ideas that would be acted out by the Hey Halfway staff members at their branch. I wrote the scripts, directed talent and production, wrote social media posts, emailers, website and all comms for this brand."
