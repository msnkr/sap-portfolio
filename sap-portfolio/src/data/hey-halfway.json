    "contentChallenge": "When it comes to second-hand car sales, they’re a dime a dozen. How do we show that we’re trustworthy?",
    "contentSolution":"People trust people who they can see and relate to. In this digital campaign, we used the staff of HeyHalfway to humanise our brand. Inspired by The Office we created a series of skits using the staff in humorous situations that would show our trustworthiness in a way that people can enjoy – No Jokes. I worked on the big idea for this campaign with my team. I came up with the brand tone, wrote the skits for the digital ads and the script for the longer ads. I wrote all other copy for this campaign including social media, Google ads, and more."
