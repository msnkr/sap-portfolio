    "contentSolution": "The world of haircare and beauty is oversaturated with societal norms. There is a rising change on social media with the “Curly Girl” hair routine as well as self-care and wash days. My team conceptualised the brand idea with the tagline I wrote “Show Yourself You Care”. An idea that’s about loving yourself and your hair by using the right products for your hair. It’s about self-expression and doing things your way, the way that suits you best and not what society tells you. We started first with the actual products and labels and have moveinto nurturing and managing the brands social media. I helped conceptualise and wrote social media posts, website, bottle labels and all comms for this brand. "
