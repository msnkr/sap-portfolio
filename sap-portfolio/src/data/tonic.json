    "brand":"Tonic is a South African wellness and haircare brand.",
    "contentChallenge": "Tonic is a new haircare brand made for all hair types, how do we create awareness and launch the brand so that it stands out in an oversaturated market?",
    "contentSolution": "There are a lot of prejudices and societal norms about hair that impact the way people take care of their hair, especially curly and textured hair. Taking care of your hair, the right way with good ingredients is like an act of self-love. Loving your hair by taking care of it is how you can Show Yourself You Care. I worked on the big idea for this campaign with my team. I wrote the brand manifesto and came up with the brand tone and personality. I wrote the tagline for the campaign, bottle labels, social media, Google ads, website, and brochure. I was part of the team that worked on all ideas for brand launch ideas, PR drops, and more."
