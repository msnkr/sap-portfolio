    "contentSolution": "Sports stars are our first heroes as kids. They are the people who inspire us twork hard. For migrant workers, their children are their world and there is nothing more important to them than school fees. My team came up with the idea of what it would be like if Beast (old Springbok rugby player) went to a school and spent the day with the kids. He is the ultimate success story for migrant workers and inspiration to their kids. I wrote the script, directed talent and production, wrote social media posts, and all comms for this campaign. "
