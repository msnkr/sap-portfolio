    "contentSolution": "Sports heroes represent the ultimate success and it is usually a dream that children have. We used the Mukuru brand ambassador, Beast, an ex-Springbok rugby player, we brought him back to school to inspire the kids in our campaign. I worked on the big idea for this campaign with my team. I wrote the script for the TV ad, radio ad, and all other copy for this campaign."
