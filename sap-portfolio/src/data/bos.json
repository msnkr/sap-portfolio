    "brand":"BOS is a South African beverage brand making iced tea, hot tea, and more from Rooibos.",
    "contentChallenge": "BOS is well known in South Africa as a healthy option, but how do we raise awareness for the brand in a creative market?",
    "contentSolution": "The brand is fun and exciting so let’s surprise and delight creatives in a creative way. We hosted a series of events and stunts. At a local artist’s market, we hung BOS iced tea from trees to mimic fruit harvesting, we hosted a high tea party with local artists and creators, and we connected a local art group with international artists. It was all about refreshment but Make It BOS! I worked on the big idea for this campaign with my team. I came up with the brand tone, wrote the tagline for the campaign, helped conceptualise and direct the events, and I wrote all other copy like social media, invites, and more.",
