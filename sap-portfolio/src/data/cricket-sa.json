    "contentSolution": "Cricket is one of the most entertaining sports with three different formats. It’s probably one of the only sports that has something that’ll appeal to every kind of person. It also is a great representative of the best of South Africans. With everything that cricket has to offer, there’s no doubt that it is the most-est sport – it’s The Most South African-est Thing We Do. I worked on the big idea for this campaign with my team. I wrote the tagline, script, social media, and more."
