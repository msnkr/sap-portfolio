    "title": "New Planet",
    "brand":"New Planet is a South African environmental tech brand focussed on solutions for people and the planet.",
    "contentChallenge": "People are numb to environmental brands. Everyone knows about global warming and the hole in the ozone layer but nobody is taking action. How do we get our message across without being preachy?",
    "contentSolution": "The planet can’t actually sustain the way humans are living. Truth is, people don’t care because there’s always been some future where we evacuate to Mars or rely on people like Elon Musk to save us. Being green has always been seen as dramatic or inconvenient. What if being green can actually be selfish – sustainably selfish meaning it’s really easy to fix our planet when we Live a New Way. I worked on the big idea for this campaign with my team. I wrote the brand manifesto and came up with the brand tone. I wrote scripts for brand videos, social media, website, Google ads, and more.",
