    "brand":"Jim Beam is an American whiskey with a rich global history.",
    "contentChallenge": "Jim Beam has some success in South Africa, but it’s not seen as a social creds brand like its competitors. People tend to buy it when it’s on sale. How do we make Jim Beam people’s first choice?",
    "contentSolution": "Make a space for Jim Beam to be socially relevant and become part of a sub-culture.  Using Jim Beam Global’s Welcome Sessions, we adapted it so that these events hosted local musicians. Bringing two different genres and fans together over Jim Beam –  All Together for The Music. I worked on the big idea for this campaign with my team. I wrote the tagline for the campaign, came up with the brand tone, wrote the script for the brand video, and all other copy like social media, print, and more."
