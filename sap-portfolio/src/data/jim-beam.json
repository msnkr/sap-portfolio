    "title": "Jim Beam",
    "content": "The challenge: How do we get post-lockdown South Africans to see Jim Beam as more than an occasional drinking option and see it as a lifestyle creds choice? The solution: South Africa has an unbelievable amount of musical talent. We used the Global Jim Beam’s Welcome Sessions brand to create live music events and connect fans to artists. So Jim Beam could become part of this new world of live music. My team conceptualised the brand idea for Jim Beam South Africa with the tagline that I wrote – All Together For the Music. Taking inspiration from the Global brand we created a uniquely South African voice that could speak to a group of under 35s that were ready to connect again. I worked together with production team and the musicians for every live event. I wrote the script, social media posts, and all comms for this brand. "
